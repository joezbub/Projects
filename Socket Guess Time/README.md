# Guess Time

Guess Time is a game where the client can guess how many seconds elapsed since the connection with the server. The server then determines whether the second value is correct. Total number correct is shown.

## Usage

First compile and execute the server like so.
```bash
g++ -o server server.cpp
./server
```
```bash
g++ -o client client.cpp
./client
```
